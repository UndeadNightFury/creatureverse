<div id="aspect"></div>
<h2>Elemental Aspect</h2>
<div class="large-text">
<p><h4>Main Form</h4></p>
<p>
Elemental Aspects have five heads, forked tongues, each head has its own individual personality and possesses its own brain with a small organ near the brain stem that acts as a heart and lung combined. This allows the head to survive indefinitely if it is severed from the body, so long as it is sustained within a rich mana field. Elemental Aspects also possess the ability to transform themselves into an anthropomorphic version of themselves, they only possess a single head in this form which is known to be trippy for them the first time they do this. A variant of this transformation ability is that instead of becoming an anthropomorphic version of themselves they transform into feral versions of wyrms with scale color based on their element. When in this state they possess a pseudo-hivemind allowing for instant communication between each other. If a head is severed it can remain in contact with the other heads or even the primus brain until it is either destroyed or starved to death. While sleeping in a hostile area Elemental Aspects are able to keep one head fully awake while the other four heads and the primus brain are fully asleep. Of the five heads, the soul/magic head is considered the primary head. Each neck is 7 meters in length.
</p>

<p><h4>Anthroid Form</h4></p>
<p>
Elemental Aspects' anthropomorphic forms possess only a single head, all five heads' personalities are jammed together in one brain while in this form. This is often debilitating to them and thus they do not like to use this form often or for very long. While in anthropomorphic form Elemental Aspects are 12 feet tall, weighing roughly 3 tons. Their anthro forms wings have thumb claws allowing them to cape their wings. While in this form they walk on digitigrade legs.
</p>

<p><h4>Wyrm Form</h4></p>
<p>
Another ability the Elemental Aspect possesses is being able to split itself into five Great Wyrm, Greater  each coloured to the Heads element. They are able to split off just one or more heads into wyrms if needed, if the separated wyrm is slain its essence is returned to the main body where it will regenerate. Each Wyrm possesses only a single heart and a pair of lungs instead of the four hearts and four lungs that the main form possesses. While the majority of the Elemental Aspect wyrm forms take the form of actual Great Wyrm, Greater  some rare Elemental Aspect have different breeds for each head (Example: Wingless Land Wyrm for Earth, Wyvern for Air, Great Wyrm for Soul, Sea Wyrm for Water and Magma Wyrm (Fire and Lava filled Great Wyrm) for Fire).</p>
