You open your maw to call for help again but nothing came out. Fear fills you as you try to take a breath only to choke. Panic sets in as you are unable to get onto your paws. You could hear the arrival of reinforcements in the distance. After several minutes of fighting for each breath, <a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank" >Slayer</a> appears in your vision.
</p>

<p>
"<a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank" >Slayer</a>, help me!" you manage to weakly rasp out.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think I will, Alpha!" he spat at you.
</p>

<p>
<a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank">Slayer</a> grabs you and quickly drags you away.

You open your maw again to call for help but all that comes out is a wet gurgle. Fear fills you as you try to take a breathe only to choke on your blood. You begin to panic as you fail to get back onto your paws. Distantly you could hear that reinforcements have arrived. After several minutes of fighting for each breath <a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank">Slayer</a> appears in your vision.
</p>

<p>
"<a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank">Slayer</a>, help me!" you manage to weakly rasp out.
</p>

<p>
"No, I don't think I will, Alpha!" he spat at you.
</p>

<p>
As <a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank">Slayer</a> grabs you to drag you away you saw the severed head of <a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#ribs" class="oc-link" target="_blank">Ribs</a> land not to far away. To your horror you could see that he was still alive as the head twitched before going still. You could hear the fighting fade into the background as <a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank">Slayer</a> drags you farther away from the rest of the pack. It wasn't long until you were secluded from everyone but Slayer who was blocking your only way out.
</p>

<p>
Before you could ponder your fate <a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank">Slayer</a> dug his right sickle claw into your underbelly and with a flick of his muscles disemboweled you. You gasped weakly as your intestines coil on the ground. You are terrified as you know this is a mortal wound and you are going to die being tortured by <a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank">Slayer</a>. You are barely aware as the next hour is filled with unending agony as your breathing gets weaker and weaker.
</p>

<p>
"This is my farewell to you, Alpha!" <a href="../../../../../../manual/oc/indoraptors.html#slayer" class="oc-link" target="_blank">Slayer</a> spat at you as he dug into your gut and tore out your weakly beating heart.
