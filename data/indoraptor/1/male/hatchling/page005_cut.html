You shove your muzzle into his belly shredding his tiny organs as you go causing him to roar in agony, struggling to escape you sink your fangs furhter into his beating heart. Jerking your head, you rip the struggling vital organ from its place in his chest. Pulling your head out of his belly you see his eyes are slits and life still fills his dying body. Moving to his head you let him see his own dying heart within your jaws. You swallow the pulsing organ befow looking toward the dying hatchling in his eyes "you were saying hatchling?" You hiss at him as you watch the life leave his eyes and his body go limb in death.
