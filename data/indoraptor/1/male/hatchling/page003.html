You leave the safety of the cave in search of food. You walk for a while before spotting some tall grass to hide in. After a while of hiding a male night fury hatchling wonders out of a nearby cave. He comes closer and closer unaware he is approaching your awaiting maw. Finally, he was close enough for you to attack. You jump out in front of him causing him to freeze. He does nothing as you walk closer to him just as you get close enough to jump him, he tries to flee.
