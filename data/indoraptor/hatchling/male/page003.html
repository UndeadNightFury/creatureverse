You leave the cove to find food. You walk for a while before hiding in some tall grass. After a while a male night fury hatchling wonders out of a nearby cave. He comes closer and closer to your waiting jaws. Finally, he was close enough to attack. You jump out in front of him causing him to freeze. He does nothing as you walk closer to him just as you get close enough to jump him, he tries to run. It was too late for him as you jump on him.
