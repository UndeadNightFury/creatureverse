As you wonder what happened you discover that you cannot feel anything below your neck. It wasn't long before panic set in when something approached by some kind of creature. It appeared to possess some kind of exoskeleton, long eyeless head with wicked looking fangs and a long boney tail with a deadly spear-like blade on the end.
</p>

<p>
"Do not try to speak, you had drowned and I saved you... Kind of." The creature said to me telepathically.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't carry your bulk so I was forced to preserve you in another way." the creature continued as I felt a sense of shock.
</p>

<p>
"My queen has allowed me to give you the option to either remain as you are or be converted into a drone." The creature finished.

Your eyes wonder across the weird fleshy room as you what what happened when you realize you cannot feel anything below your neck. Before you began to panic a large creature approached you. It had an greyish exoskeleton, eyeless head with deadly fangs and a long boney tail with a vicious looking blade at the end.
</p>

<p>
"Do not try to speak, you had drowned and I couldn't carry your entire bulk so I made a choice and cut your head off while using a symbiotic creation of the hive to keep your head alive." the Creature said much to your horror.
</p>

<p>
"The queen has allowed me to give you the option either continue as you are now with the symbiote the only thing keeping you alive or join the hive and be reborn in a new body." the Creature finished.
