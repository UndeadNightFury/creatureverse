Withering in agony you decide to tear off your own head. You put your paws on the sides of your head and with all your strength you pull as hard as you can. A rip was heard as agony filled you and your body started convulsing. You continue pulling hard and your head comes off falling into your lap pointing up at your now headless neck and the hole in your chest cavity. Your body tenses for a minute before going limp. Your head still not completely dead yet gaps like a fish trying to scream and breathe. Your slitted eyes staring at your pulsing heart thatâ€™s now slowing down with each beat now that it lacks a brain sending it signals. You can see blood squirting out of your headless neck with each beat of your slowly dying heart. Darkness clouds your vision as your brain rapidly dies from bloodloss.
