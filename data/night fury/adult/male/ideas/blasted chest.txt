you fumble the weapon and blast your chest. You let a last gasp out as your hide, skin, bones & lungs are all destroyed leaving only your still beating heart hanging they’re by its veins. you collapse down the wall behind you gasping for air with your now nonexistence lungs a trail of silver blood following you down. with your right paw you pick up your heart.

the weapon blasts your chest leaving a hole through your chest cavity and out your back. blasting away your hide, bones, muscles and lungs somehow sparing your still beating heart. You let out a death rattle as you fall back and slide down a wall leaving a trail of silver blood behind.
