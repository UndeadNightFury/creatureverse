You picked up the brand new experimental prototype energy weapon. While aiming the prototype you fumble and accidentally blast yourself in the chest while destroying the prototype. You let out a gasping rattle as you felt your hide, muscles, bones and organs ripped apart by the prototype, remarkably sparing your still beating heart. You stumble backwards into the wall behind you gasping for air, your pulsating heart was swinging with the still connected veins and arteries in and out of the wound in your chest and back in the process. Hitting the wall with a hard wet thud you claw at your throat desperately, sliding down you leave a trail of your silver blood trailing down the wall behind you.
</p>

<p>
Somehow your still alive, you stare down in disbelief at the massive gaping hole inside your chest cavity. You stare at your own silver scaly beating heart somehow completely intact despite the fact that everything else was ripped apart by the energy blast, the vital organ was still pulsating inside your chest cavity still pumping your blood throughout your body.
</p>

<p>
Your whole body is in agony while you desperately gasp for air with your nonexistent lungs. You could feel your blood leaking out of your back onto the wall and floor beneath you. The scent of your own blood and organs fills the air around you. You cough up a glop of silvery liquid as blood leaks out of the nostrils of your snout and your muzzle running down your throat. You know that you're going to die unless you figure something out.
