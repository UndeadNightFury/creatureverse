Feeling the ache in your tired wings and having scented nothing claiming this cave, you decide to explore this cave. Entering the cave your pupils grow quickly adapting to the darkness of the cave, looking around you see a small tunnel leading deeper into the cave, some exposed gem veins scattered and a bubbling pool of magma. It was as if this place was made for a dragon to inhabit!
