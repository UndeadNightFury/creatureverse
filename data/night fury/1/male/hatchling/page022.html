You walk to your dams belly and slide off onto the floor, before walking to the lower half of her chest and think about how to get at the precious organ hidden within. You recall that a dragons heart is partly exposed at the bottom of the sternum.
</p>

<p>
You use your claws and cut open your dams abdomen right below the sternum, slicing through muscle and exposing her slowing heart. You dig around her chest cavity trying to gain access to the vains at the top so you can sever the organ without damaging it.
</p>

<p>
After several minutes of careful maneuvering you managed to cut the vains and the aorta and carefully pull the weakly beating organ out of the cavity. With the beating heart drapped over your back you carefully walk over to the place you prepard for the ritual.
