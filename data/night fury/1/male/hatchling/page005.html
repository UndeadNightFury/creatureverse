The hungry Indoraptor slowly walks towards you menacingly. You yelp as he lunges at you going for a quick kill. "Help!" You yell as you try in vain to free yourself from the starving Indoraptor.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, a female night fury blasts the Indoraptor. She turns her head to face me "Hide!" she yells before she turns back toward the Indoraptor. You turn around and found a place to hide until Mother said it was safe. You watched in fear as Mother attacks the Indoraptor blasting and clawing him. It wasn’t long before the younger Indoraptor managed to get the advantage over Mother. The Indoraptor was quick to disembowel her,You looked horrified as you saw Mothers’ intestines slip out of her underbelly with a splat "No!" You shout in shock.
</p>

<p>
Mother turns to look at you with a pained look on her face "Run!" she said as the Indoraptor tears her throat out and the light rapidly left Mothers’ eyes and she collapses to the ground lifelessly.
