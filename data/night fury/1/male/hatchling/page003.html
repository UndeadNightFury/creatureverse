You leave the safety of the cave you hatched in, the sun blinding your senstive eyes for a moment. Clearing your eyes you look around and see a beautiful grove within a forest that surrounds your nest. Exploring the grove you found a small lake near some tall grass, you began to feel thirsty. Deciding to get a drink, you go to the lake to take a drink. As you get closer to the lake, a male indoraptor hatchling surprises you by jumping out of the grass. He looks really thin, almost skeletal, you think he must be really hungry!
