You growl at the indoraptor as he stalks towards you. He stalled a few meters from you having caught your scent. Now knowing that your a walking corpse he lunges at you. You effortlessly dodge the attack blasting the indoraptor with dragonfire causing him to shriek in pain. Backing up the indoraptor circles you trying to find a weakness to attack!
</p>

<p>
Analyzing the indoraptors movements you see an opening to attack and disembowel him. You also see a way to slit his throat and get at his heart or brain. Too get to his heart or brain your going to need to distract him somehow.
