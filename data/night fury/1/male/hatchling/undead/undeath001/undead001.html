You gasp as you awaken staring at what you instinctively know is your own cold dead heart. You feel freezing cold as your corpse had cooled down and all warmth had left you. Getting up you grab your heart "yipe!" you recoiled at touching the freezing cold organ. Prepared for the freezing cold feeling of the dead organ you grab it again. Putting the organ back into your chest cavity the death magic keeping you tied to your corpse heals the veins and arteries healing your chest and neck wound.

You look around seeing your eggshell and the entrance to the cave you decide it's time to leave.
