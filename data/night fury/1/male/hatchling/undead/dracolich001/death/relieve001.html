"P... p... please. Ha... Have M... m... mercy" he stammers as he coughs up a glop of crimson blood, as he collapses to the ground struggling for life.
</p>

<p>
You look him in the eyes "Sorry, but you were the one who attacked and tried to eat me not the other way around." You said as you decided that you need to relieve yourself.
</p>

<p>
As he twitches on the ground you rip open his chest cavity, breaking his ribcage and exposing his lungs and missing heart.
</p>

<p>
"Ugh! W... what a... are y... you g... g... going t... too d... d... do t... to m... me?" he stammers with blood leaking out of the corner of his maw.
</p>

<p>
"This." You say you turn around dragging your ruined intestines behind you and raise your tail. Grinning back at the terrified indoraptor as you relieve yourself straight into his chest cavity.
</p>

<p>
You stare at the indoraptors as he slowly stops his struggling, his life slowly leaves him.
</p>

<p>
"Y-you wi.. will pay for this yo... you mo... mon... monster!" he struggled to gasp out between the gobs of blood, as the blood pouring out of the severed veins slow to a stop and his eyes glass over in death.
