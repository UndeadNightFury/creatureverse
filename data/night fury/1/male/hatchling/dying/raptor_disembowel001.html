Knowing you have no chance of taking on a fully grown velociraptor. While wounded you turn and run as fast as your small legs can take you. Behind you, you could hear the raptor surge forwards toward you, rapidly catching up with you. You twist and turn in a vain attempt to lose the raptor but it was of no use, the raptor tackles you to the ground before using his sickle claw to finish gutting your underbelly open.
</p>

<p>
You screech in agony as your intestines spill onto the ground, you squirm in pain as the raptor begins his feast on your bloody organs. Wishing for it to end you are forced to endure the agony for hours while the raptor eats before it finally finishes with your belly and cracks open your ribcage.
