You fire a powerful plasma blast at the decaying wyrm, hitting him in the back. The blast blew a gaping hole in the wyrms rotting back dislodging his left lung, which fell out of his rotted out chest and onto the dragoness.
</p>

<p>
"You." The wyrm hissed out as he turned around and saw you.
</p>

<p>
You will submit to me or I will gut this... beautiful... dragoness like a worthless fish." The wyrm rasped out while taking the light fury hostage, his claws raking across her underbelly softly.
