You try to move your head but find you cannot do so. The wyrm enters your field of view, lifts your head glaring into your eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Do not worry my friend, it will take time to learn how to control a undead body." He explained to you.
</p>

<p>
He lets go of your head and it once again hangs limply before the wyrm undid the chains holding you to the wall and you collapse to the ground. You felt no pain when you hit the floor still unable to move at all. You take some time to accumulate to your new undead body, you can sense the alien feeling in your chest as your heart remains a still lump of meat.
