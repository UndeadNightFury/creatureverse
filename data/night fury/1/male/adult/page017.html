Your eyes widen in fear as your pupils narrow into slivers, at the last second you dodge to the right. Unfortunately the wyrms claws managed to tear into your chest as you dodged, you roar in pain as you stumble a bit. Your glance down and nearly threw up as you could see your ribs peaking through shredded hide, flesh and muscle. Blood gushing out of the wound with each beat of your powerful heart.
</p>

<p>
You could also see a small bit of pulsating silvery flesh and you trip over your paws as it registers in your brain what it is you are seeing peak through the wound. Looking back up you see a cave to your left, in front of you is a massive bolder, to your right is a lake...
