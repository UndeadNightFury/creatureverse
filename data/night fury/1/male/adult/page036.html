Furious you lunge at the wyrm, his dead eyes widen at your audacity and begeins to disembowel the dragoness. When you land on his back and chomp down on his head hard, throwing him off the partially gutted dragoness.
</p>

<p>You distantly hear the dragoness shriek in agony but your to focused on keeping the wyrm off of the dragoness to acknowledge it. You are quickly tossed off the wyrms back and smash into a wall, you feel your left wings bones snap. You screech in agony as you collapsed to the ground gasping for air.
