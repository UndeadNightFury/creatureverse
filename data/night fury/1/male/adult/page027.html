Quickly covering up your wound with your paw to prevent a blood trail, you dive into the cave and keep running as fast as you can go. Your pupils turn into slits as your night vision takes over. You finally stop and press against the wall, your black scales blending in perfectly with the darkness.

<p>
A moment later you could see the wyrm rush past the cave's entrance, and you wait a bit before you relax. You jump as you hear a noise from further inside.
