Your strength in your forelegs fades and you fall onto your right side as your lungs work in vain to take in precious oxygen. The dragon just watches you for a moment before grabbing your left paw and dragging you across the forest floor. Your body shudders as you spit up globs of your lifeblood with each rattling breath. Dark spots begin clouding your vision. The very last thing you see before the darkness of death claims you is the dragon's own rotting intestines hanging out of its underbelly and covering your face as it dragged your freshly made corpse to parts unknown.
