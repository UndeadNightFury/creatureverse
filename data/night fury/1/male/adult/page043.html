Ignoring the voice you get up off the soft bed the humans had you on. Snapping the cords off of your body produced a screech that hurt your ears. You collapse to the ground in pain covering your ears with your paws trying to drown out the noise.
</p>

<p>
After a minute one of the humans turned off the machine and you get up and glared hatefully at the machine before you walked over to the dragoness. She was hooked up to dozens of wires and barely breathing. Your heart nearly stopped at the sight.
</p>

<p>
"She is alive Mr. Dragon, sir," the same human voice from earlier said as he walked up to you.
