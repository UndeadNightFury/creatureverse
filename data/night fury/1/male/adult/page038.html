With barely any time to think you quickly reach into the wound you caused and claw the damaged spine, neatly severing the head from the shoulders. The wyrm lurched forwards tugging your heart painfully in its grip before going limp, you crashing to the ground with it.
</p>

<p>
Your eyes bulge in absolute agony as your heart is pulled outside your chest by the wyrm's paw before the slippery organ slid through the paw's grasp. You are left panting on the ground, blood pouring out of your injured chest. You stare in horror at the vital organ beating outside of its protection.
