The indoraptor slowly walks towards you menacingly. You yelp as he lunges at you going for a quick kill. "Help!" You yell as you try in vain to dodge the starving indoraptor.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, a female night fury blasted the indoraptor. She turned to me "Hide!" she yelled before she turned back toward the indoraptor. You turned and found a place to hide until mother said it was safe. You watched as mother attacked the indoraptor blasting and clawing him. It wasn’t long before the younger indoraptor managed to disembowel mother. You looked horrified as you saw mothers’ intestines slip out of her underbelly with a splat "No!" You shout in shock.
</p>

<p>
Mother turned to look at you with a pained look on her face "Run!" she said as the indoraptor tore her throat out and the light rapidly left mothers’ eyes and she collapsed to the ground lifelessly.
