Knowing that your no match for the indoraptor you give up. You turn onto your back exposing your underbelly to the deadly talons of the indoraptor. The indoraptor was approaching slowly as though expecting some kind of trap. As he stands in front of you, your heartbeat increases rapidly as you fear what is about to happen. You let out a squeak as he puts his left hind paw into your exposed belly his deadly talons barely touching your vulnerable hide. You know that your about to die and can do nothing about it.
</p>

<p>
You look up into his beautiful slitted golden eyes "finish it!" you said, "hehehe I will make this agonizing hatchling!" he hissed. Still looking you in your eyes he uses his sickle talon to slice into your belly causing agony to shoot up your spine. You roar in agony as your intestines spill out of your underbelly onto the warm ground with a sizzle while steam raises off your steaming organs.
</p>

<p>
He sees the pain hes causing you in your own slitted green eyes "im going to enjoy this hatchling!" he hissed.
