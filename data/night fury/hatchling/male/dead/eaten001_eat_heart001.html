You decide to eat your own beating heart instead of waiting for the acid to kill you.
</p>

<p>
Turning what’s left of your head you bite into your own beating heart. Pulling it out of what’s left of your chest cavity you swallow the still beating organ. The organ goes down your ruined throat only to fall out the hole in it and into the acid. You get to see your own beating heart dissolve in acid before death claims you.
