You stayed the course and kept charging towards the spear wielding biped. You ran headfirst straight into his spear impaling you in the center of your chest straight into your beating heart. You roar in agony as blood squirts out of your chest wound. You feel your heart struggling to pump your blood with the hole in it. Falling onto your side you flinch as the biped pulls the spear out tearing a bigger hole in your dying heart and allowing blood to flow freely. You know you only have a few precious seconds left before you bleed out you struggle to somehow plug the hole in your heart but your tiny arms are too small to reach the vital organ.
</p>

<p>
As darkness starts to consume you a female great wyrm rushes to your dying body while the bipeds start retreating. She looks you in the eye	and says, "it’s going to be alright rex, you’re going to be fine!" as she puts both her paws onto the wound sporting blood with each beat of your slowing heart. You gasp desperately for air as you struggle for life while your heart slows to a stop and the squirting blood dies down to nothing. She yells for help desperately trying to save your life as it rapidly leaves you.
</p>

<p>
Life leaves your now cooling corpse as your eyes cloud in death and your body goes limp in the great wyrms grip.
