As life leaves your majestic body the great wyrm cuts open her chest exposing her beating heart. She used her index talon to cut her heart in half before removing half her heart in an ancient ritual she put the half beating dragons heart into your cooling corpse. You gasp as you wake to the feeling of a heartbeat inside your chest despite the fact you know it was dead. You turn to the great wyrm "what did you do? you ask, "I gave you half of my heart." she replied, "we are now bound in life as long as my heart beats you live." as she finishes, you try to place a paw on your chest but your tiny arms prevent it.
</p>

<p>
All of a sudden your right arm is consumed in dragonfire as it grows into a wyrms foreleg "what?!" you yelped surprised, "yes that does happen when one is bound too a dragon like this." she replied, "you can use your connection to my half of our heart to become a great wyrm and use your half of our heart to revert to a tyannosaurus rex" she finishes. You put your now dragon foreleg onto your newly healed chest feeling your heartbeat "wow thank you for saving my life!" you say as your arm reverts to a T-Rex's arm in a flash of dragonfire.
