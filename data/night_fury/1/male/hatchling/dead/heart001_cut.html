<body>
<div class="large-text">
<p align="left">
You struggle to breathe while choking on your own bodily fluids as your body gives out and you fall to the ground. Darkness continues to slowly fill your vision as the river of blood finally starts to show signs of stopping. You start convulsing clawing at your neck struggling for oxygen you don't notice when your talon slit your own throat. You barely notice the blood stopped flowing from the gaping hole in your chest cavity. 
</p>

<p>
Feeling light headed and out of breath you try desperately to breathe. Finally you noticed that you had accidentally slit your own throat while clawing at your neck. Finally your struggles slow to a stop as your eyes cloud in death and you wheeze out a final death rattle. You never noticed that as you collapsed to the ground your now dead unbeating heart was crushed underneath the full 200 ton weight of your freshly made corpse.
</p>

<p>
Finally, dead you look down on your corpse laying their lifelessly with your blood all over the place. You can easily see into your chest cavity with all your motionless organs. You stare into your own cold dead eyes before looking under your corpse to find your own crushed heart. Looking over you find the indoraptor staring in disbelief that his meal had ripped its own beating heart out. After a few minutes he shook the shock off and walked over to your corpse. Using his sickle talon he ripped your corpses belly open spilling your dead intestines.
</p>

<p>
He started feasting on your dead organs for a while before finding your crushed heart hidden under your corpse. He bent down and bit into the crushed organ throwing it into the air before catching it and swallowing the remains of the organ whole. Pretty soon all that remained of your corpse was your tiny skeleton. You finally realize that you are very dead.
