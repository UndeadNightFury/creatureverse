Now that the indoraptor is distracted feasting on your organs, you make your move towards his heart. You use your claws to carefully cut his hide just below his sternum, he winces but otherwise doesn't notice anything. Being as stealthy as you can you pull out his heart, enjoying the feeling of the heart beating in your paw.
</p>

<p>
Now outside the protection of the chest cavity, you can see as the heart pumps the indoraptors blood through the still connected veins and arties to the rest of his body. You know it would be so easy to squash the organ and kill him that way, but you have something special for him. You carefully cut the veins and arteries connected to the vital organ causing it to squirt blood with every beat, the indoraptor has finally noticed something is wrong and he lets out a quiet gasps.
</p>

<p>
You push him off of you while pulling your remaining intestines away from him as you hold up his still beating heart so he can see what you have done.
</p>

<p>
"M... My heart!" he stammers whimpering in fear, as he reaches out to try to grab his heart from you only for you to pull it away. 
</p>

<p>
"P... p... please. Ha... Have M... m... mercy" he stammers as he coughs up a glop of crimson blood, as he collapses to the ground struggling for life.
</p>

<p>
You look him in the eyes "Sorry, but you were the one who attacked and tried to eat me not the other way around." You said as you think about what you want to do his him.
</p>

<p>
His heart pumps out the last of his blood while he lets out a death rattle and his eyes become glassy as he gives into death the last thing, he saw was you holding his dying heart.
