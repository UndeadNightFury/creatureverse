You take a second to make a plan to distract the indoraptor. You figured you could lure the hatchling in by exposing your underbelly in a fake show of an easy meal. Taking your time you slowly maneuver yourself to execute your plan. You slowly lay down on your left side, your underbelly exposed to the indoraptor's deadly sickle claw, teasing him with an easy meal.
</p>

<p>
The indoraptor hesitantly walked toward the seemingly easy meal being offered to him. He put his right hind paw onto your belly, and you could feel his racing heart pounding through the arteries in his paw and through your magic. The sickle claw was touching your hide, just barely scratching you, as you shiver under its touch.
</p>

<p>
The indoraptor starts feasting on you completely distracted by the easy meal you offered him. You now have an opening to get at his heart or brain.

Taking your time you slowly maneuver yourself so that your underbelly will be exposed. You slowly lay down on your left side your underbelly exposed to the indoraptors deadly sickle claw, teasing him with an easy meal.
</p>

<p>
The indoraptor hesitantly stalked forward towards his ever easy meal your offering to him. He put his right hind paw onto your belly, you could feel his racing heart pounding through the arteries in his paw and through your magic. The sickle claw on his paw was touching your hide just barely scratching you, as you shiver at feeling the warmth of his body.
</p>

<p>
He looks at you looking any kind of reaction but you just stay still giving him a 'go ahead' look. Before he digs his sickle claw deeply into your underbelly and dragged it diagonally across your lower abdomen, easily splitting your underbelly open disemboweling you.
</p>

<p>
You feel as your intestines slip out of your underbelly and onto the warm ground, you shiver at the warm feeling in your dead organs. You shudder as you feel the weird feeling as the indoraptor starts feasting on your intestines. Noticing that the indoraptor is now distracted feasting on your organs, you now have an opening to get at his heart or brain.
