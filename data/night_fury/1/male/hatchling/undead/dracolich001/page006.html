The indoraptor stalks towards you, causing you to let out a low growl, but he was undeterred until he was a few meters away from you. He stalled, finally having caught your scent and how you smelt of death and rot. Now knowing that you're a dracolich, he hesitates, clearly rethinking attacking you now.
</p>

<p>
You roar a challenge at the indoraptor causing him to lunge at you. You effortlessly dodge the attack, blasting the indoraptor with dragonfire, causing him to shriek in pain. You back up and keep an eye on your opponent as he circles you, trying to find a weakness to exploit.
</p>

<p>
Analyzing the indoraptor's movements you see an opening to attack and kill him, but you are going to need to distract him somehow.
